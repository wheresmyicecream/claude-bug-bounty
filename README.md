## What Is This?

**Bug bounty hunting** is when companies pay you real money to find security vulnerabilities in their websites and apps before bad actors do. Platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd connect hunters with companies. Payouts range from $100 to $1,000,000+ depending on severity.

**This tool** is a plugin for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) (Anthropic's AI coding assistant) that turns it into a professional bug bounty hunting partner. Instead of juggling 15 different tools and writing reports from scratch, you just type a command and the AI handles the rest.

**In plain terms:**
- You give it a target website
- It automatically scans the site, finds vulnerabilities, validates they're real, and writes a professional report
- It remembers what you found on past targets and applies that knowledge to new ones
- You can even put it on autopilot and let it hunt on its own while you sleep

**Who is it for?**
- Security researchers who want to move faster
- Bug bounty hunters who are tired of the manual grind
- People learning security who want AI guidance at every step

<br>

## Before vs. After

Most hunters waste hours on things that shouldn't take that long. Here's the shift:

| Before | After |
|:---|:---|
| Run 10+ tools manually, hope for the best | AI orchestrates everything in the right order |
| Write reports from scratch (45 min each) | `report-writer` agent generates submission-ready reports in 60s |
| Forget what worked last month | **Memory system** — patterns from target A inform target B |
| Submit bugs without proper validation | **7-Question Gate** kills weak findings before you waste time reporting |
| Can't see live browser traffic | **Burp MCP** or **Caido MCP** — AI reads your proxy history in real time |
| Hunt one endpoint at a time | **`/autopilot`** runs the full hunt loop while you watch |
| Anonymous recon misses auth-only bugs | **Auth-aware pipeline** — set a session once, httpx/katana/ffuf/nuclei all carry it |

<br>

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisite:** You need [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) installed and a Claude **Pro** or **Max** plan (or an Anthropic API key with credit). Claude Code itself is free to install, but the underlying model usage requires a paid plan or API billing — the free Claude.ai web account does not include Claude Code access.

**Step 1 — Install tools + skills**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuvonsec/claude-bug-bounty.git
cd claude-bug-bounty
chmod +x install_tools.sh && ./install_tools.sh   # installs scanning tools (subfinder, httpx, nuclei...)
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh               # installs AI skills + commands into Claude Code
```

**Step 2 — Start hunting**

```bash
claude                          # open Claude Code in your terminal

/recon target.com               # step 1: map the target (subdomains, live pages, URLs)
/hunt target.com                # step 2: test for vulnerabilities
/validate                       # step 3: make sure the finding is real before writing it up
/report                         # step 4: generate a professional submission report
```

**That's the core loop.** Four commands, full workflow.

**Step 3 — Go autonomous**

```bash
/autopilot target.com --normal  # AI does the whole thing, pauses for your review at the end
/pickup target.com              # continue where you left off on a previous target
/intel target.com               # get CVEs + disclosed reports relevant to this target
```

<br>

> **Don't use Claude Code?** Run the Python tools directly:
> ```bash
> python3 tools/hunt.py --target target.com
> ./tools/recon_engine.sh target.com
> ```

<br>

## How It Works

A team of specialists, each doing one job. Claude orchestrates; memory persists across sessions.

```mermaid

```

Run the whole loop, or any step on its own.

<br>

## Commands

### The Core 4 (start here)

| Command | Argument | What It Does | When |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `/recon` | `target.com` | Maps subdomains, live pages, APIs, and runs basic scans | Always first |
| `/hunt` | `target.com` | Tests for vulns using the right technique per tech stack | After recon |
| `/validate` | — | 7-question check before you write the report | Pre-report |
| `/report` | — | Generates H1 · Bugcrowd · Intigriti · Immunefi report | Post-validation |

### Power Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|:---|:---|
| `/autopilot target.com` | AI runs the full loop autonomously — recon → hunt → validate → report |
| `/surface target.com` | Ranked list of the best places to test (informed by past findings) |
| `/pickup target.com` | Untested endpoints from last session — pick up where you left off |
| `/remember` | Saves the current finding or technique to memory for future use |
| `/intel target.com` | Pulls CVEs and disclosed reports relevant to this target |
| `/chain` | When you find bug A, finds the bugs B and C that usually come with it |
| `/scope <asset>` | Checks if a domain or URL is in scope before you test it |
| `/triage` | Quick 2-minute go/no-go check — keep investigating or move on? |
| `/web3-audit <contract>` | Full smart contract security audit, 10 bug class checklist |
| `/token-scan <contract>` | Scans a meme coin / token for rug pull signals (EVM + Solana) |
| `/memory-gc` | Inspect or rotate hunt-memory JSONL files (10 MB cap, keeps 3 backups) |

### Recon Toolkit (v4.3)

Thin wrappers over external tools. Each one is gated on tool presence — missing tools are skipped, not errors.

| Command | What It Does |
|:---|:---|
| `/scope-aggregate <program>` | Pulls every in-scope asset across H1 · Bugcrowd · Intigriti · YWH · Immunefi (bbscope + bounty-targets-data) |
| `/secrets-hunt --js-bundle <dir>` | Leaked credentials in source, JS bundles, or a GitHub org (trufflehog · noseyparker · gitleaks) |
| `/takeover --recon <dir>` | Subdomain takeover candidates from a recon run (dnsReaper · subjack) |
| `/cloud-recon --keyword <name>` | Public S3 · Azure · GCP buckets + CloudFlare-bypass origin IPs |
| `/param-discover <url>` | Hidden HTTP parameters (Arjun · x8) |
| `/bypass-403 <url>` | Header · method · encoding tricks against a 403/401 |
| `/scan-cves <host>` | Focused nuclei high/critical sweep + optional log4j-scan |
| `/arsenal [tool]` | Lists installed external tools or prints an install hint |

<br>

## AI Agents

8 specialized agents, each built for one job:

| Agent | What It Does |
|:---|:---|
| **recon-agent** | Finds all subdomains, live hosts, and URLs for a target |
| **report-writer** | Writes professional, impact-first reports that get paid |
| **validator** | Runs the 7-Question Gate — kills weak findings before you waste time |
| **web3-auditor** | Audits smart contracts for 10 common vulnerability classes |
| **chain-builder** | When you find one bug, finds the chain of related bugs |
| **autopilot** | Runs the whole hunt loop autonomously with safety checkpoints |
| **recon-ranker** | Ranks the attack surface so you test the highest-value targets first |
| **token-auditor** | Fast meme coin / token rug pull and security analysis |

<br>

## What's New

### v4.3.0 — Auth Sessions + Recon Arsenal (May 2026)

- **Auth-aware hunting.** Set a session once (`--cookie`, `--bearer`, env vars, or `.private/target.json`) and every downstream tool that takes auth — httpx, katana, ffuf, nuclei, dalfox, the SQLi/SSTI/upload PoC probes — carries it. Most paying bugs (IDOR, BOLA, mass assignment, SSRF behind a login) only exist after login; the default pipeline used to miss them. See [`docs/auth-sessions.md`](docs/auth-sessions.md).
- **8 new commands.** `/scope-aggregate`, `/secrets-hunt`, `/takeover`, `/cloud-recon`, `/param-discover`, `/bypass-403`, `/scan-cves`, `/arsenal` — all under the **Recon Toolkit** table below.
- **External tool registry.** `tools/external_arsenal.sh` is the single source of truth for ~50 external tools (install hints, upstream URLs, `_have <tool>` helper). Replaces scattered `command -v` checks across the shell scripts.
- **Recon pipeline.** Optional nuclei phase in `recon_engine.sh` (off by default; gated on tool presence).
- **Methodology cheatsheet.** `skills/security-arsenal/METHODOLOGY_CHEATSHEET.md` distills per-vuln quick-check tables from HowToHunt + HolyTips + AllAboutBugBounty + KingOfBugBountyTips into one reference.

### v4.2.0 — Memory Rotation (Apr 2026)

- **Auto-rotation for hunt memory** — `audit.jsonl`, `patterns.jsonl`, and `journal.jsonl` no longer grow forever. Files rotate at 10 MB and keep 3 backups, fully transparent to writers (safe under `fcntl.LOCK_EX` for concurrent processes).
- **`/memory-gc`** — new slash command to inspect, force-rotate, or purge backup files in the hunt-memory tree.
- **22 new tests** covering rotation primitives, multi-process concurrent writes, and disk-full `OSError` propagation.

### v4.1.0 — Auto-Memory + README (Apr 2026)

- **Auto-memory at session end** — the AI now automatically logs what it tested and found after every hunt session. Memory used to stay empty until you manually ran `/remember`. Now the flywheel starts on day 1.
- README badge and stats updated, `install_tools.sh` added to Quick Start (was missing)
- `hunt-memory/` added to `.gitignore` (contains full URL history, shouldn't be committed)

### v4.0.0 — Meme Coin Security Module (Apr 2026)

- **`/token-scan <contract>`** — automated rug pull scanner for EVM and Solana tokens
- **`skills/meme-coin-audit/`** — 8 token bug classes: mint authority, freeze authority, LP locks, honeypot detection, bonding curve exploits, Solana SPL checks
- **New agent:** `token-auditor`

### v3.1.1 — CI/CD Scanner (Mar 2026)

- **GitHub Actions security scanning** built into the recon pipeline
- Auto-detects GitHub orgs from recon data and scans their workflow files
- 52 rules, 81.6% GHSA coverage — catches expression injection, secret leaks, supply chain attacks

<details>
<summary><b>Older releases (v3.1.0, v3.0.0, v2.x)</b></summary>

You also need [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) installed and a **Claude Pro or Max plan** (or an Anthropic API key with credit). The free Claude.ai web account does not include Claude Code access — that's the model billing, not the CLI.

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuvonsec/claude-bug-bounty.git
cd claude-bug-bounty
chmod +x install_tools.sh && ./install_tools.sh   # scanning tools (subfinder, httpx, nuclei, etc.)
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh               # AI skills + commands into Claude Code

## The Rules (Always Active)

These apply every session, no exceptions:

```
 1. READ FULL SCOPE FIRST   — only test what the program says you can
 2. ONLY REAL BUGS          — "Can an attacker do this RIGHT NOW?" if no, stop
 3. KILL WEAK FINDINGS FAST — 30-second check saves hours of wasted reporting
 4. NEVER GO OUT OF SCOPE   — one wrong request can get you banned
 5. 5-MINUTE RULE           — no progress after 5 min? move to the next target
 6. VALIDATE BEFORE REPORT  — run /validate before you spend 30 min writing
 7. IMPACT FIRST            — start with the bugs that have the worst consequences
```
